## Description
Cheat is undetected and up to date. ‚úÖ

A Security cheat for the game War Thunder. It's a decent piece of software with all the necessary functionality. In addition, taking into account the features of the War Thunder game, additional security work has been done, so Stream Proof is present here. Otherwise, everything is quite simple: a smooth Wallhack and a few Miscs. The pleasant thing is that the Security cheat is made using Internal technology, which guarantees high performance and no decrease in FPS in the game when using hacking. üèÜ
